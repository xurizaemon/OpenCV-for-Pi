# OpenCV for Pi
A pre-compiled binary of OpenCV for the Raspberry Pi.   It is available in a ".deb" package and will save you countless hours not having to compile it yourself.  This may or may not stay updated as I have to manually compile each version.  I will try to make available most major versions.  This was compiled on a Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+ running raspbian jessie.  This version was built with TBB which enables automagic multithreading in many OpenCV algorithms.

# Super Lazy Version
```
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jabelone/OpenCV-for-Pi/master/lazy_install.sh | sh
```
Remember to check the script before piping it into your bash! ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

# Instructions
0) Always good practice to update everything before you install stuff:
  ```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
  ```
1) We need to install some packages that allow OpenCV to process images:
  ```
sudo apt-get install libtiff5-dev libjasper-dev libpng12-dev
  ```
  If you get an error about libjpeg-dev try installing this first:
  ```
sudo apt-get install libjpeg-dev
  ```
2) We need to install some packages that allow OpenCV to process videos:
  ```
sudo apt-get install libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev libv4l-dev
  ```
3) We need to install the GTK library for some GUI stuff like viewing images.
  ```
sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-dev
  ```
4) We need to install some other packages for various operations in OpenCV:
  ```
sudo apt-get install libatlas-base-dev gfortran
  ```
5) We need to install pip if you haven't done so in the past:
  ```
wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
sudo python get-pip.py
  ```
6) Now we can install NumPy - a python library for maths stuff - needed for maths stuff.
  ```
sudo pip install numpy
  ```
7) Download and install the file from this repo called "latest-OpenCV.deb".
  ```
wget "https://github.com/jabelone/OpenCV-for-Pi/raw/master/latest-OpenCV.deb"
sudo dpkg -i latest-OpenCV.deb
  ```
8) Test it installed correctly by doing the following:
  Open a python shell
  ```
python
  ```
  Run the following commands, it should return the same version you installed.
  ```
import cv2
cv2.__version__
  ```
  
 9) Have fun with OpenCV and open an issue on GitHub if you have any problems or I forget to update it.  [pyimagesearch](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/) is a great resource to get started!
